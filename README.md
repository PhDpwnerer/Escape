# Short Description

The project will consist of a top-down 2d horror game. 
The player will be placed in a randomly generated maze and must escape 
without dying. Armed with nothing but a small flashlight, the player 
must navigate through the maze while evading the psychopath who 
is lurking in the corridors. There will be two main game modes. 
The first one is the single player mode, where the player is 
pitted against an AI controlling the ‘psychopath’. 

The second game mode is the multiplayer game mode, where there is no 
darkness and the psycopath is controlled by another player using
the arrow keys, while the player uses the w,a,s,d keys.
